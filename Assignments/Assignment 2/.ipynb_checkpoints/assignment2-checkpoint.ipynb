    "**Question 1.**  _(4 points)_\n",
    "* The answer to the main question - What categories of passengers were most likely to survive the Titanic disaster? _(2 points)_\n",
    "* **Answer:** My results show that the passsengers most likely to survive were female, in class 1, with 1 sibSp, 3 Parch, who embarked from Port C, aged 0-9 and were either paid the fare of 160-199 OR 280+ (there was one person who paid about 512 for a ticket and they survived).\n",
    "* The detailed explanation of the logic of the analysis _(2 points)_\n",
    "* **Answer:** There are two ways to analyze the categories. One is to calculate the survial rate of each category individually, and say that for example females were more likely to survive than males and so on. The second method is to analyze the other categories in an embedded or recursive manner. For example, first analyzing the sex survival rates, then within each sex, group by the class, and within that, group by Age and so on. I chose to analyze the data in the first manner because there are too many categories in the second methnd. When analyzing (grouping) with the groups _[\"Sex\", \"AgeGroup\", \"Pclass\", \"SibSp\", \"Parch\", \"Embarked\"]_ we get 112 rows of combination that have the same survival rate! This does not even include Fare (grouped fare) which will result in 144. This is too many subcategories, so I have analyzed each category by itself.\n",
    "The way I did this was by (after preparing the data) grouping the data by a category, find the number of survivors, and total number of people in the category, then dividing the two to get the survival rate. After that, find the indices of the max survival rate, and those are the categories with the highest survival rate. There may be multiple, like the fare group has two; The category 160-199 and 280+ have the same survival rate. This should be done in a for loop over the column names to cover all necessary attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do the first method, we have to do trial and error, and find reasonable (not too many categories of the same rate) category combinations, OR we must use more advanced methods. Here is a result from my analysis:\n",
    "Grouping by sex and age group: Females aged 60-69\n",
    "Grouping by sex, ageGroup and Embarked: female    60-69        C\n",
    "                                        female    60-69        S\n",
    "                                        male      0-9        C\n",
    "Grouping by sex and Class: females in class 1\n",
    "... this takes further statistical methods to conclude on one specific group.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2.**  _(3 points)_\n",
    "* What other attributes did you use for the analysis? Explain how you used them and why you decided to use them.\n",
    "* **Answer:** I used Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch, Embarked, Age, Fare attributes in my analysis because they can affect someone's survival rate. They are not Metadata, and do not describe data, rather describe the world at and universe at the time.\n",
    "* Provide a complete list of all attributes used.\n",
    "* **Answer:** Survived, Pclass, Sex, SibSp, Parch, Embarked, Age, Fare. I also used PassengerID as the index although I did not have to.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Question 3.**  _(3 points)_\n",
    "* Did you engineer any attributes (created new attributes)? If yes, explain the rationale and how the new attributes were used in the analysis?\n",
    "* **Answer:** Yes. I created two new attributes; AgeGroup and FareGroup. Because age and Fare are a more \"continous\" type of number, there are not many people with the same birthday, so they can be put into buckets. I chose 10 year buckets for age and 40 dollar range for the fare. Each bucket was used as one category representing the  age and fare attributes. If someone was 6 years old, they would be put into the 0-9 bucket and now they can be compared with those in the same range.\n",
    "    * If you have excluded any attributes from the analysis, provide an explanation why you believe they can be excluded.\n",
    "* **Answer:** I excluded Ticket number because this does not explain anything, it is only metadata. It is only a system for the organizors of the ship - it did not determine where people sat, ate or anything else that determined survival rate.\n",
    "  I excluded the PassengerID for the same reason as Ticker Number.\n",
    "  I also excluded Name as it is another metadata that does not determine survival of someone. Name in other times could be used to determine a position in socioeconomic hierarchy, but we have information like Fare, and Embarked which are much stronger than name. Someone's name did not determine where they were allowed to go, where they slept or what they ate etc. It is another metadata.\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Question 4.**  _(5 points)_\n",
    "* How did you treat missing values for those attributes that you included in the analysis (for example, `age` attribute)? Provide a detailed explanation in the comments.\n",
    "* **Answer:** I first found out which of the attributes had missing values through a for loop; Age, Cabin and Embarked had missing values.\n",
    "    * Cabin - drop the column because 77% of data is missing.\n",
    "    * Embarked -  drop the two rows that have missing data because 2 rows is very small amount (0.02%) and will not affect the loss of data.\n",
    "    * Age - age has about 20% of the its data missing. If we drop the rows, that is a lot of our data lost, and if we drop the column, we lose valuable Age information. What I did was then use groupyby statements to estimate the age based on the average of others in the same group and fill out these ages in that way. There were 7 remaining NULL values that were outside of these groups. I filled these in with the average of all ages in the data set.\n",
    "    * I double checked and there are no more missing values. "
